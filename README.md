CSS Ally
====================

DESCRIPTION
---------------------

CSS Ally is a set of PHP scripts that allow you to write clean, valid CSS while
maintaining cross-browser compatibility. This library can automatically perform
any or all of the following functions:

- Add browser prefixes for CSS rules (e.g. "-moz-border-radius")
- Minify and compress your CSS by removing excess white space, comments, and (optionally) gzipping the result
- Save the resulting code to a cached file for faster rendering on subsequent page loads.
